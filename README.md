# riot.js starterkit


This starterkit is based on:

* [riot.js](https://muut.com/riotjs/)
* [RiotControl](https://github.com/jimsparkman/RiotControl/)
* [postcss](https://github.com/postcss/postcss)

We are also using the following postcss plugins to process the CSS:

* [postcss-nested](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-nested)
* [postcss-custom-properties](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-custom-properties)

* [csswring](https://github.com/hail2u/node-csswring)
