# riot.js starterkit

With this starterkit we want to provide a simple foundation for riotjs applications.
If you have any ideas on how to improve/simplify the structure you are welcome to help us.

This starterkit is based on:

* [riot.js](https://muut.com/riotjs/)
* [RiotControl](https://github.com/jimsparkman/RiotControl/)
* [postcss](https://github.com/postcss/postcss)
* [webpack](http://webpack.github.io/)

We are also using the following postcss plugins to process the CSS:

* [postcss-import](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-import)
* [postcss-nested](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-nested)
* [postcss-custom-properties](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-custom-properties)
* [autoprefixer-core](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer-core)
* [csswring](https://github.com/hail2u/node-csswring)
